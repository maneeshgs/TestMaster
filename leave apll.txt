Dear Sir/Ma'am,

I am writing this email to inform you that I will not be able to come to work on 17/12/2022 as I have to go to sabarimala.

and i will get back to a normal routine the next day. Kindly grant me leave for a day on 17/12/2022.

Please feel free to contact me at my personal phone number in case of any 
questions or clarifications about it.
